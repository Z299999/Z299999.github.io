## Research

My research sits at the intersection of analysis, dynamical systems, and complex adaptive behaviour.

### Areas of Interest
 
- Mathematical biology  
- Control and systems theory  
- Deep learning 
- Network theory 

#### *Eco-evolutionary Neural Ecosystem*

A computational framework for studying the emergence of complex behaviours through the co-evolution of neural agents and their environment; see the interactive <a href="/pages/research/eco-evo/demo/">demo</a>.

#### *Random Vortex Method for 2D Incompressible Flows*

A dissertation project on probabilistic numerical methods for fluid dynamics, using random vortex particles to approximate vorticity and study the behaviour of incompressible flows. The work connects stochastic particle systems with partial differential equations, and explores both theoretical properties and practical simulations.

#### *Hierarchical Feature-Based Synthesis of a Brain Module*

A project on generating synthetic brain networks based on the Drosophila connectome. The work combines flow-based community detection, Hodge decomposition, centrality measures, and probabilistic modelling to reconstruct modular, hierarchical, and spatial structure in neural circuits.
