## Research

My research sits at the intersection of analysis, dynamical systems, and complex adaptive behaviour.

### Areas of Interest

- Partial differential equations  
- Mathematical biology  
- Control and systems theory  
- Deep learning and representation learning  
- Network theory and complex systems  

### Eco-evolutionary Neural Ecosystem

A computational framework for studying the emergence of complex behaviours through the co-evolution of neural agents and their environment.
